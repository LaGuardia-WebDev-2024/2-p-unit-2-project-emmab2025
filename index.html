    <p id="fun-facts"><strong> FUN FACTS</strong></p>
    <ol>
      Seahorses prefer to swim in pairs with their tails linked together.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      They swim upright and avoid predators by mimicking the colour of
      underwater plants.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Except for crabs, few marine predators eat the seahorse – it is too bony
      and indigestible.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Seahorses are actually fish, and they live in water and breathe through
      gills.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      They are terrible swimmers.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      They eat a lot and by suction.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      They use their tails like hands.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Males carry the eggs.
    </ol>

    </p>

    <ol>
      Seahorses are mainly found in
      <mark class="trop"> tropical shallow</mark>
      and temperate salt water throughout the world, from about 45°S to 45°N.[8]
      They live in sheltered areas such as
      <mark> seagrass beds, estuaries, coral reefs, and mangroves.</mark>
      Four species are found in Pacific waters from North America to South
      America. In the Atlantic, Hippocampus erectus ranges from Nova Scotia to
      Uruguay.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Sea Horses are
      <mark class="carn"> carnivorous fish.</mark>
      Sea Horses can easily chew their food thanks to their long snouts. Yet,
      because they take a long time to finish their meals and have very basic
      digestive processes without stomachs, they must continually feed in order
      to survive. Smaller crustaceans that are swimming or burrowing on the
      bottom are what seahorses hunt.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Sea Horses ambush anything that floats within striking distance using
      their superior camouflage, waiting patiently for the right opportunity.
      <mark> Mysid shrimp and other little crustaceans are top choices.</mark>
      The three unique feeding phases in Sea Horses are anticipatory, expansion,
      and recuperation.
    </ol>
    <p id="Why-are-they-born-with-different-colors">
      <strong> WHY THEY ARE BORN WITH DIFFERENT COLORS?</strong>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Genetics plays a significant role in determining the base colors and
      patterns of seahorses. Specific genes control the development and
      distribution of chromatophores during embryonic growth. Variations in
      these genes lead to the diverse colorations seen across different species
      and even among individuals of the same species.
